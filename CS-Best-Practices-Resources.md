# CS Best Practices: Canonical Resources

Foundation reading for clean-code skill synthesis.

> **Coverage note:** Not every book listed here drove the `/quality` framework's synthesis. About 10 of the 24 books here are deeply integrated into the agents (Clean Code, Refactoring, APOSD, Clean Architecture, GOOS, Art of Unit Testing, xUnit Test Patterns, Working Effectively with Legacy Code, DDD, Release It!). The remainder are listed for context, future reference, or because their concepts already filter through other primary sources. For the honest "what's actually synthesized vs. what's just listed" breakdown, see [`Code-Quality-Skills/README.md`](Code-Quality-Skills/README.md#whats-deliberately-not-synthesized).
