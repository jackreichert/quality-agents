# Code Quality Skills — Sources & Index

## What this is

This repo is a **code-review framework** that runs inside [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/claude-code) (via the `/quality` slash command) and [GitHub Copilot](Copilot-Integration.md) (via per-skill prompts). It spawns specialized review agents — for code quality, architecture, refactoring, testing, security, delivery, distributed systems, design patterns, persistence, and process discipline — against your current `git diff` and aggregates their findings into a severity-ranked verdict (`SHIP IT` / `NEEDS WORK` / `SIGNIFICANT ISSUES`).

Each agent is a focused lens. The orchestrator picks which lenses are relevant to the diff, runs them in parallel, deduplicates overlap, and returns one report.

## How it was created

The framework is a **distillation of the canonical CS literature** into agent-executable form. The pipeline:

1. **Source selection.** A reading list of ~24 canonical books plus key articles and papers (Clean Code, Refactoring, A Philosophy of Software Design, Clean Architecture, GOOS, Designing Data-Intensive Applications, PEAA, Release It!, Continuous Delivery, GoF, the OWASP standards, etc.) — the full inventory lives in [`CS-Best-Practices-Resources.md`](CS-Best-Practices-Resources.md).
2. **Per-source summaries.** Each book/article was summarized into a structured note in [`Resources/`](Resources/) (Books, Articles, Papers, Standards, Originals). These summaries capture the principles, smell catalogs, patterns, and counterpoints from each source — not full reproductions, but enough to drive synthesis.
3. **Cross-source synthesis into skills.** The summaries were synthesized into ~12 topical **skill documents** in [`skills/`](skills/) — the canonical, human-readable references. Each skill cites the specific chapters and articles that drove each section, and reconciles tensions between sources (e.g., Clean Code ch.4 vs. APOSD ch.12-15 on comments).
4. **Agent compilation.** Each skill is compiled into a concise **agent prompt** at `~/.claude/agents/quality-*.md` (and a parallel Copilot prompt under [`copilot/prompts/`](copilot/prompts/)). The agents are the executable form; the skill files are the reasoning trail.
5. **Orchestration.** The `/quality` slash command routes a diff to the relevant agents, runs them in parallel, normalizes severity, and aggregates the report.

The "Sources by Skill" section below shows exactly which book/article/chapter informed each part of each skill, so any finding the framework produces can be traced back to a primary source.

For the master inventory of every book and article that informed this work, see [`CS-Best-Practices-Resources.md`](CS-Best-Practices-Resources.md). For the lineage of individual sections within each skill, see "Sources by Skill" further down.

## Quick start

Install into [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/claude-code):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jackreichert/quality-agents.git
cd quality-agents
bash install.sh
```

Then in any git repo, run `/quality` from Claude Code.

### What it does

`install.sh` deploys:

- 11 agent files into `~/.claude/agents/quality-*.md`
- The `/quality` orchestrator into `~/.claude/commands/quality.md`

Each agent is wired to read its canonical reference from wherever you cloned this repo (the absolute path is substituted in at install time, replacing the `__SKILLS_DIR__` placeholder in the bundled files under `claude/`). Re-running the installer is idempotent — files already up to date are skipped, no backups created.

### Useful flags

```bash
bash install.sh --dry-run             # show what would happen
bash install.sh --force               # overwrite without backups
bash install.sh --uninstall           # remove deployed files
bash install.sh --skills-dir /path    # canonical docs live elsewhere
bash install.sh --claude-home /path   # non-standard ~/.claude location
bash install.sh --help
```

### GitHub Copilot

`install.sh` only installs the Claude Code side. The Copilot integration (`copilot/prompts/`, `copilot/global-instructions.md`, `copilot/AGENTS.md`) is configured manually — `install.sh` prints the exact steps at the end of a run, and the full guide lives in [`Copilot-Integration.md`](Copilot-Integration.md).

### Contributing

The framework keeps three synchronized copies of every agent (canonical → bundle → deployed). See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the editing flow and the `bundle.sh` script that captures live edits back into the repo.

### Lineage Notes

| Current file | Lineage |
|--------------|---------|
| `skills/review.md` | Started from the `code-reviewer` agent and absorbed the old `review-pr` orchestrator workflow |
| `skills/refactor.md` | Synthesized from Fowler/Feathers and absorbed the old `code-simplifier` behavior-preserving cleanup mode |
| `skills/process.md` | Built from Jack's CLAUDE.md "Planning Process" section, grounded in Code Complete + Pragmatic Programmer + Clean Coder + MMM + APOSD |
| `skills/delivery.md` | Synthesized fresh from Continuous Delivery + Trunk-Based Development + 12-Factor + Feature Toggles (Hodgson) — no prior agent ancestor |
| `skills/distributed.md` | Synthesized fresh from DDIA + Waldo's "A Note on Distributed Computing" + Microservices/CQRS/Event Sourcing — no prior agent ancestor |

| `skills/security-review.md` | Adapted from the `security-auditor` agent and extended with explicit security standards references |

### Orchestration

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `~/.claude/commands/quality.md` | The `/quality [aspects]` command — routes to agents, aggregates findings (Claude Code) |
| `copilot/prompts/quality-*.prompt.md` | Per-skill prompts for GitHub Copilot Chat (12 files) |
| `copilot/global-instructions.md` | Condensed personal-instructions snippet for github.com + VS Code user settings |
| `copilot/AGENTS.md` | Repo-level cross-tool template (Claude Code, Copilot, Cursor, Continue all read it) |
| `Copilot-Integration.md` | How to set up the framework with both Claude Code and Copilot |

### Tool integrations

The framework is designed to work in **both Claude Code and GitHub Copilot**:

- **Claude Code**: full slash-command + parallel agent orchestration (auto-routes via `git diff` signals).
- **GitHub Copilot**: per-skill custom prompts + global personal instructions + AGENTS.md. Same review content; different workflow.

See [`Copilot-Integration.md`](Copilot-Integration.md) for the dual-tool setup.

#### Capability matrix

| Feature | Claude Code | GitHub Copilot |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| Slash command | `/quality` orchestrator | Per-skill prompts (`/quality-code`, `/quality-arch`, ...) |
| Auto-routing by diff signal | ✅ orchestrator inspects `git diff` and selects relevant agents | ❌ user picks the prompt manually |
| Parallel agent execution | ✅ multiple agents run simultaneously, results aggregated | ❌ one prompt at a time |
| Severity aggregation across lenses | ✅ orchestrator deduplicates and normalizes | ❌ user reads each result separately |
| Git-diff awareness | ✅ native — orchestrator passes the diff to each agent | ⚠ partial — works on open file/selection; diff must be pasted or accessed via Source Control view |
| Tool augmentation (SAST/SCA/secrets) | ✅ agent can run `semgrep`, `bandit`, `npm audit`, `gitleaks` etc. | ❌ Copilot Chat can't execute tools — prompt suggests user run them |
| Per-skill modes (e.g., simplify vs full refactor) | ✅ aspect keyword selects mode | ⚠ split into two distinct prompts (`/quality-simplify` vs `/quality-refactor`) |
| Personal global instructions | ✅ `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | ✅ github.com personal instructions + VS Code user settings |
| Repo-level instructions | ✅ `CLAUDE.md` in repo root | ✅ `.github/copilot-instructions.md` or `AGENTS.md` |
| Custom agent definitions | ✅ `~/.claude/agents/quality-*.md` | ✅ `.prompt.md` files in user-shared location |
| Suggestion follow-ups (e.g., "code-quality flagged smells → run /quality patterns") | ✅ orchestrator surfaces them automatically | ❌ user remembers to chain manually |
| Confidence scoring + ≥80 threshold filter | ✅ built into agent prompts | ✅ same — built into prompt files |
| Coverage of canonical sources (skills' content) | ✅ identical | ✅ identical |

#### Copilot-side limitations to plan around

These are inherent to Copilot's architecture, not gaps in this framework:

1. **No parallel orchestration.** A complex change that Claude Code reviews via 5+ agents in one shot becomes 5+ sequential prompt invocations in Copilot. Reviewing schema changes that touch persistence + delivery + security needs three separate `/quality-*` runs.
2. **No git-diff auto-context.** Copilot Chat reads the active file/selection, not the full diff. Workarounds: paste the diff into chat, use the VS Code Source Control view's Copilot integration, or open each changed file before invoking the prompt.
3. **No tool execution in Copilot Chat.** The security prompt can't run `semgrep` or `npm audit` itself; it surfaces which tools would augment its findings and asks the user to run them. For full tool-backed security review, use Claude Code's `/quality security`.
4. **No mode-of-modes routing.** Claude Code routes `simplify` and `refactor` to the same agent in different modes; in Copilot they're two prompt files. Pick the right one explicitly.
5. **No automatic suggestion chaining.** When `quality-code-quality` flags many smells, the Claude Code orchestrator suggests `/quality patterns` and `/quality refactor` follow-ups; in Copilot you remember to chain.
6. **AGENTS.md adoption is uneven across tools.** Claude Code reads `CLAUDE.md`; recent Copilot reads `.github/copilot-instructions.md`; Cursor reads `.cursorrules`. Drop `AGENTS.md` and symlink/duplicate to the per-tool filename if the tool doesn't read AGENTS.md directly.

When the workflow shape matters (parallelism, diff-awareness, tool augmentation), prefer Claude Code. When you're already in VS Code or reviewing a github.com PR, the Copilot path is faster — same content, more manual.

**⚠ Orchestrator may need updating** for the 4 new skills — the routing logic that auto-selects agents based on diff signals doesn't yet recognize `delivery`, `distributed`, `patterns`, or `persistence` as aspects. Until that's added, the new agents are reachable only via direct Task invocation or explicit aspect names (`/quality delivery`, `/quality persistence`, etc., assuming the orchestrator falls through to literal aspect names).

**Pattern:** Confidence-scored review (≥80 threshold), CLAUDE.md-driven, bug detection + general code quality, plus merged PR-review orchestration modes (`quick`, `full-pr`, `targeted-follow-up`).

**Agent files**: `quality-review.md` and `quality-security-review.md` were derived from these canonical skills and now exist at `~/.claude/agents/`.

### `skills/security-review.md`

**Source:** `security-auditor` agent from `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/claude-plugins-official/plugins/code-modernization/agents/security-auditor.md`

**Pattern:** Adversarial OWASP/CWE review with exploit scenarios. Backed today by:
- **OWASP Top 10:2021** (web application security risks)
  - A01 Broken Access Control, A02 Cryptographic Failures, A03 Injection, A05 Security Misconfiguration, A06 Vulnerable Components, A07 Identification/Auth Failures, A10 SSRF → existing systematic checklist
  - **A04 Insecure Design** → architectural threat-modeling subsection (trust boundaries, abuse cases, secure design patterns, no security-by-obscurity, defense in depth)
  - **A08 Software/Data Integrity Failures** → supply chain subsection (pinned deps + lockfile review, signed artifacts, CI/CD trust boundaries, SBOM)
  - **A09 Security Logging/Monitoring Failures** → detection subsection (auth events, sensitive ops, failed-access logging, log integrity, retention, alert routing)
- **Selected OWASP ASVS control families** for code-review-relevant checks (authentication, session management, access control, validation, crypto, configuration, logging)
- **CWE catalog** (Common Weakness Enumeration)
- **SAST**: Semgrep (OWASP Top 10 + secrets + security-audit rulesets), CodeQL for deep taint analysis, plus language-specific scanners (Bandit, ESLint-security, gosec, Brakeman, SpotBugs+find-sec-bugs)
- **SCA**: `npm audit`, `pip-audit`, `govulncheck`, `bundle audit`, OWASP Dependency-Check, Trivy
- **Secrets scanning**: gitleaks, trufflehog
- **IaC scanning**: checkov, tfsec, trivy config

**Tool stance:** tools are recommended, not required. Their absence is *not blocking* — the review proceeds via manual code reading. But missing/failed tools must be called out explicitly so the coverage profile is visible to the reader.

## What's Deliberately Not Synthesized

The master resource list (`../CS-Best-Practices-Resources.md`) includes books that are **listed for context but did not deeply drive any skill's synthesis**. Each row links to the resource summary in `Resources/` for reference.

| Source | Why not (yet) integrated | Summary |
|--------|--------------------------|---------|
| **SICP** | Foundational/educational; principles already filter through Clean Code, FP basics, and the patterns skill | [Resources/Books/Language-Specific/24-SICP.md](Resources/Books/Language-Specific/24-SICP.md) |
| **NASA's Power of 10 Rules** | Safety-critical-C focus; overlaps with code-quality but not a full skill | [Resources/Standards/04-NASA-Power-of-10.md](Resources/Standards/04-NASA-Power-of-10.md) |

### Recently absorbed into new skills

The 4 new skills (delivery, distributed, patterns, persistence) closed many gaps that previously appeared here:

| Source | Now in skill |
|--------|--------------|
| **Continuous Delivery** (Humble & Farley) | `skills/delivery.md` — Build Discipline, Deployment Pipeline, Migrations |
| **Trunk Based Development** (Fowler / Hammant) | `skills/delivery.md` — Trunk-Based Development Hygiene section |
| **Twelve-Factor App** | `skills/delivery.md` — Configuration, Process Hygiene, Logs sections |
| **Feature Toggles** (Hodgson via Fowler) | `skills/delivery.md` — Feature Flags section (4-category taxonomy) |
| **Designing Data-Intensive Applications** (Kleppmann) | `skills/distributed.md` (chs.5-9, 11) + `skills/persistence.md` (chs.2-3, 7) |
| **A Note on Distributed Computing** (Waldo et al. 1994) | `skills/distributed.md` § 0 — organizing principle |
| **Microservices** (Fowler & Lewis) | `skills/distributed.md` — Microservice Boundaries section |
| **CQRS, Event Sourcing** (Fowler) | `skills/distributed.md` — CQRS / Event Sourcing section |
| **Design Patterns / GoF** | `skills/patterns.md` — full vocabulary, smell→pattern map, anti-patterns |
| **Head First Design Patterns** | `skills/patterns.md` — modern OO framing, anti-pattern warnings |
| **PEAA pattern catalog** (Active Record, Data Mapper, Unit of Work, Repository, Lazy Load) | `skills/persistence.md` — full catalog application |
| **Effective Java** | Partial — items 7-9 (resources) in `skills/persistence.md`; items 17-18 (composition) in `skills/patterns.md`. The full 90 items remain language-specific and aren't a standalone skill |

### Already partially absorbed (from earlier work)

| Source | Where it appears |
|--------|------------------|
| **Mythical Man-Month** (Brooks) | `skills/process.md` — Brooks's Law, blast radius, essence vs. accident |
| **Joel on Software** — *Painless Software Schedules* | `skills/process.md` — estimation discipline |
| **Joel on Software** — *Things You Should Never Do* | `skills/refactor.md` — motivates Strangler Fig |
| **Branch by Abstraction**, **Strangler Fig** (Fowler bliki) | `skills/refactor.md` — Large-Scale Refactor Strategies section + `skills/delivery.md` cross-ref |
| **Google Engineering Practices** | `skills/review.md` — Review Priority Order, CL-size guidance |
| **GOOS** ch.18 *Listening to the Tests* | `skills/test-quality.md` — organizing principle |
| **Release It!** | `skills/architecture.md` § 5 (resilience patterns) + `skills/distributed.md` § 10 cross-ref |

## How to Update

When extending or revising a skill:

1. **Edit the Obsidian file in this directory** — that's the canonical source of truth
2. **Mirror the change in the corresponding agent file** at `~/.claude/agents/quality-*.md` — keep agent files concise; full reasoning lives here
3. **If adding a new source**, update both:
   - The skill's "Sources" line at the top of its file
   - This README's "Sources by Skill" section
4. **If adding a new aspect to the orchestrator**, update `~/.claude/commands/quality.md`'s aspect routing table and tips section

## Worked Example: A Full `/quality` Session

A walkthrough so you (or future-you in 3 months) can re-orient.

### Scenario
You just finished a feature: added an `/api/users/:id/orders` endpoint that fetches a user's orders. Files changed:
- `src/routes/users.ts` (new endpoint handler)
- `src/services/orderService.ts` (new method `getOrdersForUser`)
- `src/services/orderService.test.ts` (one new test)

### Step 1 — Ready to commit, run the default
```
/quality
```

The orchestrator:
1. Runs `git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree` → confirms git repo
2. Runs `git diff` and `git diff --name-only` → identifies the three changed files
3. Auto-selects agents based on detectable signals:
   - `quality-code-quality` (always, source files changed)
   - `quality-architecture` (new function/endpoint adds structural surface)
   - `quality-test-quality` (test file in diff)
   - `security-auditor` (file in `routes/` path)
   - `quality-refactor` Mode 1 (last, polish pass)
4. Spawns all 5 in parallel via `Task`
5. Each returns severity-tagged findings
6. Orchestrator deduplicates, normalizes severity, aggregates

### Step 2 — Read the report

Hypothetical output:
```
## Critical — Fix Before Committing
- [security-auditor] src/routes/users.ts:18 — IDOR: no ownership check;
  user A can fetch user B's orders by changing the path param

## Important — Fix Before PR
- [quality-test-quality] orderService.test.ts:42 — only happy path tested;
  missing test for non-existent userId
- [quality-architecture] orderService.ts:15 — direct DB import in service
  layer; should go through repository

## Minor — Worth Doing
- [quality-code-quality] orderService.ts:23 — variable `data` is vague;
  rename to `userOrders`

Counts: Critical: 1 | Important: 2 | Minor: 1
Verdict: SIGNIFICANT ISSUES
```

### Step 3 — Fix Critical, re-run

Add the ownership check, re-run `/quality`. If now `NEEDS WORK`, fix the Importants and re-run. When `SHIP IT`, commit.

### Step 4 — Optional: targeted follow-ups

Want named refactoring moves for the architecture finding?
```
/quality refactor
```

Mode 2 returns specific Fowler moves (e.g., "Extract Repository — mechanics: ...").

## Smoke Test Recipe

Before relying on `/quality` for anything important, run it once on a low-stakes diff to confirm everything wires up.

```bash
# In any git repo with some uncommitted changes:
cd ~/some-test-repo

# Make a trivial change — anything that produces a diff:
echo "// test comment" >> src/some-file.ts

# Run the framework:
# (in Claude Code session)
/quality
```

**Expected:**
- Orchestrator detects the change
- Agents spawn (you'll see "◆ Spawning agents in parallel...")
- Each returns a report
- Aggregated output with verdict appears
- Verdict on a trivial comment-only change should be `SHIP IT` or maybe one Minor finding

**If it doesn't work:**
- Agent fails to spawn → check `~/.claude/agents/quality-*.md` exists
- Orchestrator says "no diff found" but you have changes → check `git status`
- Output format looks broken → see Troubleshooting below

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| `/quality` not recognized | Command file missing or permission issue | `ls ~/.claude/commands/quality.md` — recreate if missing |
| Orchestrator asks for files instead of using diff | Not a git repo OR no changes | `git status` — confirm you're in a repo with uncommitted work |
| Agent returns nothing useful | Diff is empty or trivial | Verify `git diff` shows substantive changes |
| Agent times out | Diff too large | Run targeted aspect on subset: `/quality code` on specific file |
| Severity counts don't match findings | Some agent didn't tag severity inline | Check that agent file has the `[CRITICAL]/[IMPORTANT]/[MINOR]` tagging instruction |
| Security findings get swallowed | CVSS not normalizing correctly | Check the orchestrator's severity-normalization table — `~/.claude/commands/quality.md` |
| Output is severity-grouped but I want category-grouped | Default is severity-grouped (orchestrator); per-agent reports are category-grouped | Run agents directly via `Task` tool for per-agent category view |
| Agents disagree about a finding | Expected — different lenses | Orchestrator preserves the most severe rating during deduplication |

If output is consistently broken, smoke-test a single agent directly via the `Task` tool to isolate whether the bug is in the orchestrator or the agent.

## GSD Integration

`/quality` composes naturally with the GSD workflow. Recommended insertion points:

| GSD command | When to add `/quality` | Why |
|-------------|------------------------|-----|
| Between `/gsd:execute-phase` and `/gsd:commit-phase` | Run `/quality` on the phase's changes | Catches issues before atomic phase commit |
| Before `/gsd:ship` | Run `/quality code arch tests security` | Comprehensive pre-PR review |
| After `/gsd:verify-work` validates UAT criteria | Run `/quality process` | Audits planning discipline retroactively |

**Not yet integrated automatically** — these are manual additions to your workflow. If the integration becomes standard practice, candidates for automation:
- Add `/quality` invocation to `gsd-verifier`'s checklist
- Add a workflow toggle in `planning/config.json`: `workflow.quality_gate: true`

For now, run `/quality` manually at the points above. If you find yourself doing it consistently, that's the signal to automate.
