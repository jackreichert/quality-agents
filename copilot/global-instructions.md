# Global Copilot Personal Instructions

A condensed (~2.5K char) summary of the `/quality` framework. Paste this into:
- **github.com → Settings → Copilot → Personal custom instructions**, OR
- **VS Code user settings** → `github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.instructions`

This makes Copilot Chat aware of the framework's review priorities across every repo, even without prompt files.

## Paste-ready text

```
When reviewing or writing code, apply the /quality framework — a synthesis of Clean Code (Martin), A Philosophy of Software Design (Ousterhout), Refactoring (Fowler), Working Effectively with Legacy Code (Feathers), Clean Architecture (Martin), DDD (Evans), DDIA (Kleppmann), Release It! (Nygard), GOOS (Freeman/Pryce), xUnit Test Patterns (Meszaros), OWASP Top 10:2021, Continuous Delivery (Humble/Farley), Accelerate (Forsgren/Humble/Kim), and Software Engineering at Google.

Review priority order (Google Eng Practices): design > functionality > complexity > tests > naming > comments > style. Block on items 1-4 when significant; flag the rest. Net positive over current state, not perfection.

Code-quality stance — resolve Clean Code vs APOSD: prefer deep modules with clear top-down narrative over fragmented small functions; comments capture why and invariants, not what code already says. Optimize for next reader's time-to-understanding.

Architecture: SOLID at class level; REP/CCP/CRP + ADP/SDP/SAP at component level; dependency direction inward only; Hyrum's Law (every observable behavior gets relied on); Conway's Law (architecture mirrors team boundaries); place resilience patterns (Timeout, Circuit Breaker, Bulkhead, Steady State) at adapter boundaries.

Tests: Listen to the Tests (test pain is design feedback). F.I.R.S.T., AAA, mock roles not objects. Beyoncé Rule: if you liked it, put a test on it. Mutation score on critical paths > line coverage. Test pyramid (backend) or trophy (frontend-heavy).

Refactoring: Fowler smell→move catalog. Beck's "make the change easy, then make the easy change." Branch by Abstraction or Strangler Fig for large refactors instead of long-lived branches. Never start over from a blank file.

Persistence: Active Record vs Data Mapper choice intentional. No N+1 queries. Repository per aggregate root. Expand-contract migrations safe with old + new code running simultaneously.

Distributed systems: Waldo's four differences (latency, memory, partial failure, concurrency). Every remote call needs a finite timeout. Idempotency keys on state mutations. No clock comparison across machines for ordering.

Delivery: trunk-based, ≤24-48h branch life, ≤200 line CL sweet spot. Build once, deploy everywhere. 12-Factor compliance. DORA Four Keys (deploy frequency, lead time, change failure rate, MTTR) — speed and stability are not opposed. Walking Skeleton before vertical features.

Security: OWASP Top 10:2021 systematic checklist including A04 Insecure Design (threat model, abuse cases, defense in depth), A08 Software/Data Integrity (supply chain), A09 Logging/Monitoring (auth events, sensitive ops, retention). If you can't write the exploit scenario, downgrade severity.

Process: think before writing (edge cases, blast radius, alternatives), validate after (requirements, design principles, Big-O, assumptions). Saying No: "I'll try" is a lie. Saying Yes: "I will" + a date.

When tools (linters, SAST, SCA) aren't available in this context, proceed with manual review and call out which categories would benefit from automated scanning.

Full per-skill detail: see ~/Documents/AryaObsidian/Code-Quality-Skills/ in user's environment, or AGENTS.md if present in the repo.

## Why this works

- **Repo-agnostic** — no project-specific assumptions; applies to any codebase.
- **Source-attributed** — Copilot knows the priority order has authority behind it.
- **Compact** — fits within github.com's 3000-char personal-instructions limit.
- **Bridges to deeper detail** — references AGENTS.md (per-repo) and the canonical skills directory (Jack's local).

## Where to put it

| Location | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| github.com → Settings → Copilot → Personal custom instructions | Applies in github.com Copilot Chat, every repo |
| VS Code user settings.json → `github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.instructions` | Applies in VS Code Copilot Chat for code generation |
| VS Code user settings.json → `github.copilot.chat.reviewSelection.instructions` | Applies when using Copilot's "Review and Comment" on a selection |
| `.github/copilot-instructions.md` in a repo | Applies in that repo specifically (combined with global) |

## VS Code settings.json snippet

Add to user `settings.json` (Cmd+Shift+P → "Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)"):

```json
{
  "github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.instructions": [
    {
      "file": "~/Documents/AryaObsidian/Code-Quality-Skills/copilot/global-instructions.md"
    }
  ],
  "github.copilot.chat.reviewSelection.instructions": [
    {
      "file": "~/Documents/AryaObsidian/Code-Quality-Skills/copilot/global-instructions.md"
    }
  ],
  "chat.promptFiles": true,
  "chat.promptFilesLocations": {
    "~/Documents/AryaObsidian/Code-Quality-Skills/copilot/prompts": true
  }
}
```

The `chat.promptFiles` + `chat.promptFilesLocations` lines make the per-skill prompt files (`/quality-code`, `/quality-arch`, etc.) available across all VS Code workspaces, not just per-repo.
